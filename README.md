#Linear Regression - Ecommerce Customers

The "Linear Regression - Ecommerce Customers" project is a data analysis and predictive modeling task that focuses on understanding the factors that influence customer spending in an Ecommerce company. The project aims to build a linear regression model to predict the "Yearly Amount Spent" by customers based on various features.

Project Overview:

Dataset: The dataset contains customer information from an Ecommerce company, including features such as "Avg. Session Length," "Time on App," "Time on Website," "Length of Membership," and "Yearly Amount Spent." The "Yearly Amount Spent" is the target variable that we want to predict.

Objective: The main objective of this project is to explore the relationships between customer attributes and their spending behavior, and subsequently build a linear regression model to predict the yearly spending of customers based on the provided features.

Data Exploration: The project begins with data exploration and descriptive statistics to gain insights into the dataset. Key aspects include understanding the data types, checking for missing values, and obtaining basic statistical information about the numerical features.

Correlation Analysis: A correlation matrix is created to understand the strength and direction of relationships between the numerical features and the target variable. This analysis helps identify which features have a significant impact on customer spending.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA involves data visualization techniques using seaborn and matplotlib to explore the relationships between key features and the target variable. Joint plots and pair plots are used to visualize these relationships and discover patterns and trends in the data.

Model Building and Evaluation: The project proceeds to build a linear regression model using scikit-learn's implementation. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to train the model and evaluate its performance. Various evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared, and Explained Variance Score are used to assess the model's accuracy.

Residual Analysis: Residuals are examined to assess the model's performance and check for any patterns or biases that might indicate areas of improvement.

Cross-Validation: The model's performance is further validated using K-Fold Cross-Validation and Shuffle Split Cross-Validation techniques to ensure its generalization to new data and prevent overfitting.

Insights and Conclusion: The project concludes with insights into the most influential factors affecting customer spending in the Ecommerce company. The linear regression model can be utilized for making predictions about potential customer spending based on their attributes.

Project Impact:

The "Linear Regression - Ecommerce Customers" project helps the Ecommerce company better understand its customers and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. By predicting customer spending, the company can optimize its sales and marketing efforts, offer personalized recommendations, and enhance customer satisfaction and retention. The insights gained from the project contribute to data-driven decision-making and business growth.
